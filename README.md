# Multi-view-GAN
This repository aims to build a generated model for Multi-View image generation.
Input: N views of something.
Output: M different views of the thing.
# How to run it?
~~~
python stargan.py --retrain True
~~~
---
Now the discriminator can't discriminate which view the image is. And generator can't generate right images.
There are lots of things to do.
